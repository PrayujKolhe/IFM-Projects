In this project, I interfaced the IFM Static Inclination Sensor JN2100 with the ecomat Controller CR711S to monitor angular positions. The sensor data was visualized in real time using graph traces for better interpretation and analysis.
This type of sensor is commonly used in applications such as:

1. Aiming and adjusting tank turrets to precise angles

2. Stabilization systems in submarines

3. Tilt monitoring in bottle-filling production lines
