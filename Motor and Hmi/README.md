This project involves controlling a motorâ€™s speed and direction using an HMI connected to a CR711S PLC. Users can set the speed and choose between clockwise or counterclockwise rotation through the HMI interface. The system was programmed in CODESYS, enabling real-time control and feedback display for smooth motor operation.
